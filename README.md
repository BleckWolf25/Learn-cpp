# LEARN-CPP

Welcome to **LEARN-CPP**, a beginner-friendly repository designed to teach the fundamentals of C++ programming. This repository is ideal for those new to programming or C++ and serves as a stepping stone to understanding essential concepts. If you don’t master these fundamentals, you won’t be ready to go to advanced topics or more complex programming paradigms.

Each folder in this repository represents a lesson, and each lesson includes a `README.md` file with detailed explanations, code examples, and exercises. Follow the lessons in order to build a strong foundation in C++.

## Table of Contents

| Lesson Number | Lesson Name                 | Description                                      |
|---------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 1             | FirstCppApp                 | Create your first C++ application (Hello World). |
| 2             | ConstAndNamespaces          | Learn about constants and namespaces in C++.     |
| 3             | VariablesAndMath            | Explore simple mathematical operations in C++.   |
| 4             | TypedefAndAlias             | Understand `typedef` and type aliases.           |
| 5             | FullMath                    | Master variables and intermed arithmetic in C++. |

## Lessons Order

To ensure a smooth learning experience, follow the lessons in this order:

1. **FirstCppApp**
   - Build your first C++ program, starting with the classic "Hello World" example, and understand the basic structure of a C++ program.

2. **ConstAndNamespaces**  
   - Learn how to use constants to store unchanging values and organize code with namespaces.

3. **VariablesAndMath**  
   - Understand variables (declaring, initializing, and scoping) and perform intermedium arithmetic operations.

4. **TypedefAndAlias**  
   - Explore how to create aliases for data types using `typedef` and modern C++ type aliases (`using`).

5. **FullMath**  
   - Dive into mathematical operations, including operators, precision, and common math functions in C++.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BleckWolf25/LEARN-CPP.git
   ```

2. Install a C++ compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang) and an IDE or text editor like Visual Studio Code (VSCode project files are included in each lesson).

3. Follow the `README.md` in each lesson folder for step-by-step instructions, code examples, and exercises.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of programming concepts (optional but helpful).
- A computer with a C++ compiler and IDE/text editor installed.

## Contributing

If you’d like to contribute lessons, examples, or improvements, feel free to fork this repository, make changes, and submit a pull request. Please ensure your contributions align with the beginner-friendly focus of this project as one person doing all by themselves is hard.

**Note:** Back long time ago, each lesson had it's own repository now everything is in a single repository and each folder is a lesson.

Happy coding, and welcome to your C++ journey!
